## Cryptography Resources

### The Bcrypt Gem

We mentioned in class that when confirming a user's password Bcrypt doesn't actually do any decryption. So how does it actually work?

How do we check for equality between two values in Ruby? With a `==`.

The creators of bcrypt took advantage of that convention and Rubyâ€™s syntactic sugar and wrote a method called `def ==(secret)`.

So when we compare the stored password_hash to a password from a sign in form like this:

```ruby
  @user.password == params[:password]
```
what we are actually doing is calling `def ==(secret)` method like this:

```ruby
  @user.password==(params[:password]). 
```
This `def ==(secret)` method takes params[:password] (the password that a user submitted when signing in), runs it through the hashing algorithm to create a hash, and compares this new hash to the password_hash. If they match, `def ==(secret)` returns true.

Pretty cool, huh? 

You can take a closer look at `def ==(secret)` in the [Bcrypt gem](https://github.com/codahale/bcrypt-ruby) in this file: `bcrypt-ruby/lib/bcrypt/password.rb`
